# FirmWire

FirmWire is a full-system baseband firmware analysis platform that supports Samsung and MediaTek. It enables fuzzing, root-cause analysis, and debugging of baseband firmware images. **See the [FirmWire documentation](https://firmwire.github.io/docs/installation.html) to get started!**

FirmWire is licensed under BSD-3 and developed by "Team FirmWire", which currently consists of the authors on the NDSS paper unless stated otherwise. We expect FirmWire to be used for commercial purposes (e.g. private baseband vulnerability research, bug bounties, etc.). The license permits this. We (Team FirmWire) _request_ that users in these settings notify us through public (e.g. issues) or private (e.g. email, Signal) means about your use. We are curious! If FirmWire or derived work helped you find a vulnerability, we'd also like to know in order to add it to the FirmWire trophy wall. Finally, one or more members of Team FirmWire may be willing to provide consulting services such as trainings, custom extensions to FirmWire, advice, and the like. Please reach out if interested.
