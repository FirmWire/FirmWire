# Trophy Wall

FirmWire is intended as tool to find security critical bugs and to ease baseband specific research.
As such, we are happy to showcase how FirmWire is used! On this page, you can find details to vulnerabilties found with FirmWire, talks about the framework, and blogposts describing its usage.


## Vulnerabilities

So far, FirmWire was involved in finding the following vulnerabilities:
