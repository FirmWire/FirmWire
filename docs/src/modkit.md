## Modkit

One of the core features of FirmWire is it's modkit, which allows to create and compile own modules and tasks to be injected in the emulated baseband image.
The modkit serves as bases for our [fuzzing](fuzzing.md) modules, as well as the [GuestLink interactive exploration](interactive.MD) capabilities.
